Proposal for usage of dose3-distcheck (for debian packages)
===========================================================

edos-debcheck [option] ...

Given an input set of package stanzas, each of which in deb-control(5)
format, checks installability of packages from the point of view of
inter-package relations expressed in the package stanzas (depends,
conflicts, and provides). The test set comprises the set of packages
that are checked for installability. The test set is always a subset of
the inputs set, it may be the same as the input set or may be further
restricted (see the options below concerning input and test set).

By default, only the number of non-installable packages in the test
set is displayed (see "output options" for how to change this).

Options
=======

Input and test set
------------------

-i, --input <file>
  add package stanzas from <file> to the input set and the test set,
  where '-' denotes standard input. These packages will be checked for
  installability.

-I, --input-dontcheck <file> 
  add package stanzas from <file> to the input set only, where '-' denotes
  standard input. These files will not be checked themselves for
  installability but will only be used to resolve dependencies.

  Options -i and -I may be repeated, however standard input may be used
  at most once.

-co, --checkonly <packagenames>
  where <packagenames> is a comma-separated list of package names. Restrict
  the test-set to packages whose name is in <packagenames>. The notion
  'src:<sp>' in <packagenames> denotes the list of all packages that have
  Source <sp>.

-col, --checkonly-latest
  restrict the test-set to packages that are in the most recent version among
  all packages of the same name in the input set.

Output
------

-f, --failures
  print the list of non-installable packages in the test-set

-s, --successes
  print the list of installable packages in the test-set

  It is possible to specify -f and -s together in order to obtain
  installablity information for all packages in the test-set.

-e, --explain
  print an explanation in case of non-installability (only useful when
  used in combination with -f).

-q, --quit
  be less verbose, don't show timing or progress meters.

-d, --debug
  print debugging information

Info
----
-h, --help
  Summary of command usage

-v, --version
  Print version


Note: the -xml option will be dropped since we will move to an output
format that is both human readable and machine parsable (YAML?)

===========================================================================


edos-builddebcheck:

the same as for edos-debcheck, except that -i would be used for source
packages (which go into the test set) and -I for binary packages
(which do not go into the test set).
