- Make reason in depsolver lazy. This way we can save a bit of time 
  when building the sat problem

- find a way to add a proper (debian/rpm/real) version to missing 
  dependencies. atm this information is lost when traslating the 
  problem to cudf

- fix the broken dependencies explanation list. The reason list
  sometimes does not include broken packages at the end of a reson
  list. The solver does not provide this information.

- add minisat backend to the depsolver
