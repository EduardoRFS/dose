- make reason in depsolver lazy. This way we can save a bit of time 
  when building the sat problem

- find a way to add a proper (debian/rpm/real) version to missing 
  dependencies. atm this information is lost when traslating the 
  problem to cudf
** DONE !

- fix the broken dependencies explanation list. The reason list
  sometimes does not include broken packages at the end of a reason
  list. The solver does not provide this information. Actually this is 
  a problem with distcheck.
** DONE !

- add minisat backend to the depsolver

- when init the depsolver, create a new data structure where all dependencies
  and conflicts are explicit. Then use this data structure when iterate
  over packages. This way we can perform all lookups once and forall.
** DONE

- fix common/EdosSolver documentation. For some reason only part of it is
  actually generated

- implement a debdistcheck that builds the sat problem directly from 
  debian Packages without passing through cudf and friends
** WONTFIX
