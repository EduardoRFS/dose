This script finds pairs of packages that share at least one file, and
that are co-installable according to debcheck.

Usage:

potential-file-conflicts -c <file> ... -r <file> ... -o <directory>

Options may be given in any order. 

-c <file> : specifies a Contents file. The syntax of this file is
   the one of Contents files as to be found on debian mirrors. May be
   repeated in order to use several contents files.
-r <file> : gives the name of a repository (debian Packages file). These
   files may be compressed with gzip or bzip2, provided that the distcheck
   tool has been compiled with support for these compression methods.
-o <directory> : write the result into <directory>. This directory is created
   by the script, and must not exist when the script is called.

For every pair of packages pa and pb that are found by the script,
the directory specified in the -o option will contain a file named
pa:pb. The contents of this file is the list of all file names that
are known to exist in both packages, one filename per line.

Needs the python YAML module (debian package: pythom-yaml)
