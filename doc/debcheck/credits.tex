Jérôme Vouillon is the author of the solving engine. He also wrote the
first version of the program (called \textsc{debcheck} and
\textsc{rpmcheck} at that time), which was released in November 2005.

The initial development of this tool was supported by the research
projects \emph{Environment for the development and Distribution of
  Open Source software (EDOS)}, funded by the European Commission
under the IST activities of the 6th Framework Programme. Further
development and maintenance of the software, together with new
applications building on top of it, are funded by the research project
\emph{Managing the Complexity of the Open Source Infrastructure
  (Mancoosi)}, funded by the European Commission under the IST
activities of the 6th Framework Programme, grant agreement 214898.

The tool, the underlying theory and its application, was described in
\cite{edos2006ase}.
