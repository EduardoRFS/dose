\section{Input Data: Packages and Repositories}
\label{sec:data}
\subsection{Packages}
Debian control stanzas are defined in \texttt{deb-control (5)}. For
\debcheck{} only the following fields are relevant, all others are
ignored:
\begin{description}
\item[Package] giving the package name.
\item[Version] giving the version of the package.
\item[Architecture] specifying the architectures on which the package
  may be installed. Optional, defaults to \texttt{all}.
\item[Depends] is a list of items required for the installation of
  this package. Each item is a package name optionally with a version
  constraint, or a disjunction of these. Optional, defaults to the
  empty list.
\item[Pre-Depends] are by \debcheck{} treated like Depends.
\item[Conflicts] is a list of package names, possibly with a version
  constraint, that cannot be installed together with the package. Optional,
  defaults to the empty list.
\item[Breaks] are by \debcheck{} treated like Conflicts
\item[Provides] is a list of names symbolizing functionalities realized by the
  package. They have to be taken into account for dependencies and conflicts
  of other packages, see Section~\ref{sec:installability}.
\end{description}

In particular, \texttt{Recommends} and \texttt{Suggests} are ignored
by \debcheck. Also, \debcheck{} does not check for the existance of
fields that are required by Debian policy but that are not relevant
for the task of \debcheck, like \texttt{Maintainer} or
\texttt{Description}. *** Is this true?

** What is with the Essential field ??

\subsection{Repositories}
A \emph{repository} is a set of package stanzas. This set may be given
to \debcheck{} in form of a single file or as several files, in the
latter case the repository is constituted by all stanzas in all input
files (see Section~\ref{sec:invocation}). \debcheck{} makes two
important assumptions on the repositories; if any of these is not
satisfied then it exits with an error:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We assume that there are no two package stanzas in the repository
  that have both the same value of \texttt{Package} and the same value
  of \texttt{Version}. Having different versions for the same package
  name is OK, as it is of course OK to have two stanzas with different
  package names and the same version.

  As a consequence, the pair of package name and package version is a
  unique identifier of a package stanza inside a given repository. In
  the following, when we speak of \emph{a package}, we mean a precise
  package stanza that is identified by a name \emph{and} a version,
  like the package of name \texttt{gcc} in version \texttt{4:4.3.2-2}.
  The stanza with name \texttt{gcc} and version \texttt{4:4.4.4-2}
  would constitute a different package.
\item
  We assume that the values of the \texttt{Architecture} fields are
  consistent, that is that there exists a single architecture that
  matches all these architecture values. Currently (policy version
  3.9.1), this means that all architecture values are either
  \texttt{all}, or the same specific architecture.

  An exception is the \texttt{-a \textit{<architecture>}} option which
  allows to restrict the repository to those package stanzas who's
  architecture field is consistent with a given concrete architecture
  (see Section~\ref{sec:invocation}).
\end{itemize}
