.BI \-checkonly \ list
where \fIlist\fR is a comma-separated list of package names.  Check only
for installability of packages with name in \fIlist\fR (of any
available version). This means that if a package does not exist in
the input pool then the test passes (since all available versions are
in that case installable). However, a warning is issued in case a package
mentionend in \fIlist\fR is not available.

In the context of this option, a package of the form src:\fIp\fR expands
to the list of all packages that stem from the source package \fIp\fR.
