.SH NAME
dose3-buildcheck \- check installability of build-dependencies

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdose3-buildcheck\fR [option] ... \fIbinary-repository\fR \fIsource-repository\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dose3-buildcheck
determines, for a set of debian source package control stanzas, called
the source repository, whether a build environment for the packages of
the source repository can be installed by using packages from the
binary repository. For this, only package meta-information is taken
into account: build-dependencies and build-conflicts in the source
package, and inter-package relationsships expressed in the binary
repository.
.P
The constraint solving algorithm is complete, that is it finds a
solution whenever there exists one, even for multiple disjunctive
dependencies and deep package conflicts. This problem is
computationally infeasible in theory (that is, NP-complete), but can
be solved very efficiently for package repositories that actually occur
in practice.
.P
Installability of binary packages is analyzed according to their
\fBDepends\fR, \fBConflicts\fR, and \fBProvides\fR fields with their
meaning as of Debian policy version 3.9.0. \fBPre-depends\fR are
treated like \fBDepends\fR, and \fBBreaks\fR are treated like
\fBConflicts\fR.

.SH INPUT FORMAT

The \fBbinary-repository\fR argument is the name of a file containing
stanzas in the format of deb-control(5), separated by one blank
line. For instance, the Packages files as found on a Debian mirror
server, or in the directory \fI/var/lib/apt/lists/\fR of a Debian
system, are suitable.
.P
The \fBsource-repository\fR argument is the name of a file containing
debian source control stanzas, separated by one blank
line. For instance, the Sources files as found on a Debian mirror
server, or in the directory \fI/var/lib/apt/lists/\fR of a Debian
system, are suitable.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a \-\-architecture 
Specify the architecture for which installability of build
environments should be checked. This argument is (in the current
version of this program) mandatory.
.TP
.B \-f \-\-failures
Only show broken packages that fail the installability check.
.TP
.B \-v \-\-successes
Only show packages that do not fail the installability check.
.TP
.B \-e \-\-explain
Explain the results in more detail.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable info / warnings / debug messages. This option may be repeated
up to three times in order to increase verbosity.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display this list of options.

.SH EXAMPLE
Compute the list of source packages in Sources for which it is not possible
to install a build environment on i386, assuming that the binary packages
described in file Packages are available:

dose3-builddebcheck --architecture i386 --failures --explain Packages Sources

.SH AUTHOR
The current version has been rewritten on the basis of the dose3
library by Pietro Abate; it replaces an earlier version that was 
simply a wrapper for edos-distcheck.
