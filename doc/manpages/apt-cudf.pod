apt-cudf - CUDF solver integration for APT

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over

=item B<solvername>

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

apt-cudf translates back and forth among a CUDF-based dependency solver and the
protocol used by APT to talk with external dependency solvers. apt-cudf
therefore allows to use any CUDF solver as an external solver for APT.

apt-cudf relies on its C<argv[0]> name to find the CUDF solver to invoke.  In
common setups, you should have a CUDF solver specification file under
F</usr/share/cudf/solvers/> for each installed CUDF solver. To use one such
solver with APT, you should create a symbolic link pointing to
F</usr/bin/apt-cudf> under F</usr/lib/apt/solvers/> and call it with the name
of the CUDF solver you want to use.
