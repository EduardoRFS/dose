=item B<ceve> [-h] [-v] [-e I<pkgspec>] [-c I<pkgspec>] [-r I<pkgspec>] [--depth=I<n>]I<> [-T I<format>] [-G I<graph type>] [-o I<filename>] I<input-spec>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ceve is a generalized metadata parser. It reads package specifications,
extracts package metadata from them, performs some manipulations, and outputs
the package metadata in one of several formats. 

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-h> 

This option displays the help message. Can also be specified as B<--help>. 

=item B<-v> 

Be verbose. This option can be repeated for more verbosity. 

=item B<-e >I<pkgspec> 

(Option Not Implemented Yet) Extract the transitive closure of packages connected (by conflict or
dependency) to any of the packages that satisfy I<pkgspec>. Such a package
specification is a list of packages (separated by a semicolon), where each
package is specified as follows: (I<name>,I<version>).I<> This option can also
be specified as --extract=I<pkgspec>.I<> 

=item B<-c >I<pkgspec>

Similar to the B<-c> option, but only uses the dependency relation to make
the transitive closure. This option can also be specified as --cone=I<pkgspec>.I<>

=item B<-r >I<pkgspec> 

Similar to the B<-e> and B<-c> options, but uses the reverse dependency
relation to make the transitive closure. This option can also be specified
as --rcone=I<pkgspec>.I<> 

=item B<--depth >I<n> 

In combination with the B<-e>, B<-c> or B<-r> options, this
specifies the maximum depth for the transitive closure. 
=item B<-T >I<format> 

Specifies the output format to use. Possible values are B<dot> for a graph
output in Dot/GraphViz format, B<cnf> for an output in CNF format, B<dimacs>
for an output in the DIMACS format for CNF formulae, and B<cudf> for a
pretty-print output in an RFC 822-like format.

=item B<-t >I<input-spec>

Select the input type.

=item B<--request >I<installation-request>

Specifies an installation request of the form "B<install:> I<vpkglist>" or
"B<remove:> I<vpkglist>" or "B<upgrade:> I<vpkglist>" where I<vpkglist> is a list of (real)
packages possibly associated with a constraint. Ex.: bash (< 2.0), exim (=
3.1-debian1). This option can be repeated to specify install, remove and
upgrade actions.

Examples:

=item --request "install: bash (< 2.0), exim (= 3.1-debian1)" --request "upgrade: apt-cudf"

=item B<-G >I<graph type> 

Specifies the graph type format to compute. This option must be used together
with the option B<-T >I<dot|gml|grml>. Possible values are:

=item

B<syn> for the syntactic graph where disjunctions nodes and conflicts are
explicitely added to the graph. 

=item

B<pkg> for the package graph where all dependencies are threated uniformely and
conflicts are not added to the graph.

=item

B<strong> the strong dependency graph.

=item

B<conj> the conjunctive graph where only conjunctive dependencies are
considered.

=item B<-o >I<filename> 

Instead of stdout, send output to the file I<filename>.

=item I<input-spec> 

This is a URL specifying both the input format and the file to get the input
from. Possible schemes are: 

=item

B<cudf> for cudf files 

=item

B<deb> for Debian package files (possibly compressed with L<gzip(1)> or
L<bzip2(1)>, depending on compile-time options for dose3) 

=item

B<debstdin> for Debian package files read from standard input 

=item

B<edsp> for apt-get External Dependency Solver Protocol

=item 

B<eclipse> for Eclipse (p2) package files 

=item

B<pgsql> for PostgreSQL databasess 

=item

B<sqlite> for sqlite databases

=item

B<hdlist> for RPM hdlists 

=item

B<synth> for urpmi synthesis hdlists 

Some examples of URLs: 
 
=item

deb://Packages.gz (the Debian file packages.gz in the current directory)

=item

cudf:///home/examples/cudf/test.cudf (the CUDF file /home/examples/cudf/test.cudf)

=item

psql://user@db.mancoosi.org:723/packages (the database I<packages> on host I<db.mancoosi.org>
on port 723, accessed as user I<user>)
