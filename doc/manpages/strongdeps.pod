=head1 NAME

strongdeps - indentify the strong dependency of a set of packages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<strongdeps> [option] ... I<file> ... 

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<strongdeps> computes the strong dependencies and the impact set of a
set of packages. We say that p strongly depends on q if whenever p
is installed then q must also be installed. The impact set of a
package q is the set of all packages p that strongly depend on q.

=head1 Input Specification

Input files have to contain stanzas in the format of
L<deb-control(5)>, separated by one blank line. For instance, the
Packages files as found on a Debian mirror server, or in the directory
I</var/lib/apt/lists/> of a Debian system, are suitable as input. The
repository used in the analysis consists of the union of all packages 
from the input files.

=head1 Output Specification

The output of strongdeps is a CSV table containing strong dependencies,
impact set and direct dependencies. If the option B<--checkonly> is 
spefified, B<strongdeps> prints on standard output the dot representation
or the strong dependencies. Since B<--checkonly> computes only the strong
dependencies of a set of packages, the impact set with relation to the 
entire universe is not computed.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--dot>

Save the strong dependency graph in dot format

=item B<--dump>

Save the strong dependency graph in the file data.dot

=item B<--table>

Print the table (package,strong,direct,difference) in the file data.csv

=item B<--detrans>

Perform the transitive reduction of the strong dependency graph

=item B<--transitive-closure>

Perform the transitive closure of the direct dependency graph

=item B<--checkonly> I<package>[,I<package>] ...

Specifies a list of packages to check. By default all packages are
checked. B<--checkonly> and B<--table> are mutually exclusive.

=item B<--conj-only>

Use the conjunctive graph only

=item B<-v>
 
Enable info / warnings / debug messages. This option may be repeated up to
three times in order to increase verbosity.

=item B<--progress> 

Display progress bars. 

=item B<-h>, B<--help> 

Display this list of options.
