Dose3 needs ocaml >= 3.11.2
On debian, dose3 **does not compile** on debian lenny.

required libraries ( DEBIAN / RPM ) :
 - libextlib-ocaml-dev / ocaml-extlib-devel
 - libpcre-ocaml-dev / ??
 - camlp4

additional libraries (enable compilation with --with-<library>) :
 - libpostgresql-ocaml-dev / ocaml-postgresql-devel
 - libsqlite3-ocaml-dev / ocaml-sqlite-devel
 - libzip-ocaml-dev / ?
 - libbz2-ocaml-dev and libbz2-dev / ?
 - libjson-static-camlp4-dev / ?
 - libocamlgraph-ocaml-dev / ?
 - libounit-ocaml-dev / ocaml-ounit-devel
 - librpm-dev / librpm-devel
 - libexpat-ocaml-dev (for --with-xml)
 - libbenchmark-ocaml-dev (for --with-benchmark)

To use rpm support, dose3 needs librpm > 4.6
To use ocamlgraph support, dose3 needs libocamlgraph-ocaml-dev >= 1.5.1

To compile from git :
aclocal -I m4
autoconf
./configure
make

--with-rpm4
--with-rpm5
--with-xml
--with-ocamlgraph
--with-sqlite
--with-postgresql
--with-zip
--with-bz2
--with-oUnit
--with-curl
--with-experimental

libcudf is included in the source tree of dose3 available by svn but
not in the dose3 release tarball. By default dose3 uses the system
wide version of libcudf. To use the version of libcudf in the source
tree you can specify --without-libcudf as configure option. If using
an independently installed version of libcudf you'll need version >=
0.5.99.

--with-experimental configure the enviroment to build experimental 
programs.

Example:
./configure --without-libcudf --with-xml --with-curl --with-ocamlgraph --with-zip --with-oUnit --with-bz2 --with-rpm4 --with-experimental

Compiling applications
----------------------
In order to compile the a selection of applications do "make". To
compile specific application

$cd applications/
$ocamlbuild $app.native

Some application might benefit from a fine-tune of the ocaml garbage collector.
You migth try to set the following values before running your application:
OCAMLRUNPARAM=s=4M,i=32M,o=150

Install
-------

./configure --prefix=/path/to/ 
make
make install

by default dose is installed in /usr/local/{lib,bin}
